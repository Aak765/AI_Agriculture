## Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that suggests optimal irrigation amounts (in mm) for crops. This is achieved by training a Random Forest Regression model on a dataset containing critical agricultural parameters. The notebook AI_agriculture.ipynb covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

*Note:* For demonstration purposes, the 'optimal_irrigation_mm' target variable in this notebook is synthetically generated based on other features. In a real-world application, this data would come from actual measured optimal irrigation levels.

## Features

* *Data Loading:* Handles loading agricultural data from a .csv or .xlsx file.
* *Data Preprocessing:*
    * Cleans column names.
    * Manages missing values (imputation with mean for numerical, mode for categorical).
    * Synthetically generates 'optimal_irrigation_mm' for demonstration.
    * Performs one-hot encoding for categorical features (soil_type, crop_type).
* *Machine Learning Model:* Implements a Random Forest Regressor for predicting irrigation.
* *Model Evaluation:* Assesses model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
* *Visualization:* Provides a scatter plot to visualize actual vs. predicted irrigation values.

## Dataset

The project expects a dataset (e.g., Rice_dataset.csv.xlsx) with the following columns (after cleaning):

* unnamed:_0 (potentially a date or index column)
* crop_type
* soil_type
* soil_ph
* temperature
* humidity
* wind_speed
* n (Nitrogen content)
* p (Phosphorus content)
* k (Potassium content)
* crop_yield
* soil_quality
* optimal_irrigation_mm (This is the target variable, synthetically generated in the notebook)

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

* pandas
* scikit-learn (sklearn)
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn

Model Performance:
The Random Forest Regressor model is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. Lower MSE indicates better fit.

R-squared (R2): Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. R2 ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.

Example output from the provided notebook:

Model Performance:
  Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.50
  R-squared (R2): 0.85
Visualization
A scatter plot is generated to visually compare the actual optimal irrigation values (simulated) against the values predicted by the model. A diagonal line represents perfect prediction, allowing for easy assessment of the model's accuracy.
